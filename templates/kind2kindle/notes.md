# kind2kindle theme notes
## Concept
A stripped back theme that is easy to use with Kindle and allows access to the major functionality of COPS
## Exclusions
The intention is that ths theme is forced on older Kindle browsers that have limited support for JavaScript. As such this theme avoids use of any scripting, with one exception - a button that allows reversion to the default theme.
